    </entry>
    <entry>
      <int>2</int>
      <string>You are standing inside the entrance to the dungeon. This rounded
stone and earth room bears the marks of digging tools and a number of
assorted claw and hoof marks in the walls and floor. The only obvious
exits are back up the stone stairway you just decended, to the west,
down a plain earthen tunnel, and to the northeast through an enormous
rough-hewn stone door.</string>

      <string>You are in a large cavern.</string>

    <entry>
      <int>4</int>
      <string>You stand in a large cavern cluttered with stalagmites and stalagtites
that divide the room into many smaller chambers and passages and limit
vision in any direction to a few feet. The maze-like form of this cavern
is somewhat unnerving, as if someone or something had used natural forces
to create a very unnatural labyrinth. You have entered the lair of the
minotaur. The only exits are to the north and through an iron bound
oak door to the southeast.</string>

      <int>6</int>
      <string>You are now in a fairly large, but somewhat filthy cavern which smells
of urine and excrement. Tattered rags, broken bones, as well as ruined
weapons litter the floor. You get a great sense of foreboding as you
realize the carnage that must have taken place here. Caves exit to the
north, south, and southwest. There is also an iron door to the east.</string>

    <entry>
      <int>8</int>
      <string>You gape in awe at the piles of skulls in the center of this huge stone
room. The walls of this room are draped with the furs and skins of many
different types of animals, among which you recognize the furs of several
cave bears, formidable opponents themselves. The only visible exit is back
the way you came.</string>

      <string>The ceiling of this cavern is shrouded in darkness above your head. The
whole room is roughly circular with the exit to the south. Though the
walls and floor give away the fact that many battles have been fought
here, and several of them recently, you see no sign of the slain or the
equipment they may have carried. To the northeast is an unadorned bronze
door.</string>

    <entry>
      <int>12</int>
      <string>You stand in a circular shaft with a stairwell that decends around the
outer wall into the darkness below. The air in this chamber is somewhat
cooler than that outside the bronze door. From far below comes a faint
shuffling sound that is barely audible and which you can make nothing of.</string>

    </entry>
    <entry>
      <int>94</int>
      <string>The splendor of the hall before you could have come right out of some
fantasic storybook legend. Enormous ornately carved black marble columns
inlaid with platinum and ivory bigger around than you are tall rise far
above to the ceiling, towering some two hundred or more feet above your
head. The floor and walls of this great hall are adorned with ornately
carved tiles and other noteworthy architecture with a very definite origin,
dwarves. The far wall of this hall is barely visible some thousand feet
away. Several things about this hall lead you to believe that either it&apos;s
original creators or someone or something has kept it up over the aeons.
Many torches in sconces along the walls light the hall about as brightly
as any underground room could be expected to be. The sheer size and
elegance of this magnificent hall leaves you in awe of it&apos;s builders.
The only visibile exits lie to the north through a grand archway, and to
the southeast through an ornately carved stone door.</string>

      <string>This cave smells strongly of animals. It has the look and feel of

bones and skulls of various creatures, human and otherwise. An enormous
palet of furs and skins lies on one side of the room, and by the size

east and southeast.</string>

dragon with razor talons and teeth as large and sharp as sabres. The

before you. You have heard of caverns such as this, where subteranian
streams and thousands of years of time wear away rock and create scenery
that can be seen no place else. You peer into the darkness between natural
formations including stalagtites and stalagmites, some over twenty feet
tall. Something about this chamber unnerves you, despite the apparently
peaceful setting. From what you can see, the only exit is to the west.</string>

distance across the middle of this enormous chamber is roughly three
hundred feet. The high domed ceiling is supported by immense pillars of
the same black stone which stand as high as one hundred feet. The floor
and walls of this chamber are pitted here and there with marks that seem
to have been made by various blades and other weaponry. There are also
many places where the stone is charred or cracked as if damaged by extreme
heat or cold. The heavy air in this chamber is oppressive and reeks of
death and charred flesh. The floor is covered sparesly by a fine blackish
grit composed of stone flakes, metal shavings, bits of bone, and ash. You
see no visible means of egress. An overwhelming sense of impending doom
disheartens you greatly.</string>

      <string>This side chamber off of the reception area is likewise richly appointed and furnished.  It appears to be a bedroom. There are fine tapestries and draperies covering the walls, and a large luxurious bed dominates a pedestal in the center of the rear wall. The only exit appears to be east.</string>

      <string>This room is the most impressive and richly appointed of any you have seen in these depths. Huge columns of black stone run through with veins of precious metals rise high to the vaulted ceiling. Many marvelously crafted frescoes and tapestries adorn the walls and ceiling adding colour and character to this grand room. The central pathway to the dias on which the mighty throne sits is carpeted with thick indigo material that appears almost lusterous. The throne itself is intricately carved from a solid piece of black stone and inlaid with precious metals and gemstones of various types so that the colours form paterns which captivate the eye.</string>

      <string>This wide chamber appears to be a smithy for forges, workbenches, and other odds and ends about the whole place. There is also evidence of magickal experimentation or practice in the form of ritual circles and some few workbenches scattered with magickal paraphenalia. In the center of the room is a full suit of scale mail armor complete with helmet and shield on a wooden figure. The armor is brightly polished and seems very reflective. The helmet&apos;s visor is raised so that the dummy&apos;s face shows through. The shield is at a slight angle to the figure&apos;s breast. The exits are east and west.</string>

Northward you can catch a glimpse of the elven valley.  Directly west
you view the town of Talshan.  Far to the south you can see the
swamps and the Tower of Sorcery a tad to the west of them.  A distance
to the northwest you can see the river flowing toward the Seas of
Palthorak, and the northern docks of Talshan.  You can very faintly
see the desert that breaks near the northern Ocean of Galinor.  A fair
day&apos;s walk to the west you also see a gigantic glacier cutting into the
mountainside.  And here from the top of the volcano you have this
beautiful view.  You can climb back down to the northwest or enter the
volcano downward.  But beware, there is much peril within.</string>
