You are standing on the docks. The water from the lake laps quietly against
the docks making the peaceful scene on the lake all that more serene. A path
leads towards a large open plaza to the northwest.
l ship
The ship's captain is a grizzly old sailor with many a scar, several tatoos
and an unkempt manner about him. His worn clothes appear to have seen just
about every port there could possibly be, and he smells of stale sweat and
cheap rum.

are bought and sold by a shrewd mage in crimson robes with an air of
power and complete confidence about him. He doesn't look like someone
whose spells you'd like to be on the wrong end of. The sweet scent of
incense drifts in from a workroom in the rear of the shop. The exit is
to the south.
l crim
The mage wears red robes and radiates an aura of power and confidence. He
has flowing white hair and a long white beard, though his face does not

depicting various scenes of a religious or magical nature block your view
into the many other areas of the temple. Blue robed priests and acolytes
move here and there going about their duties. The exit is to the north.

There is a barkeep, and a barmaid here.
There is nothing on the floor.
l
You are in the town's inn. The smoke from the many oil lamps decrease
visibility to your imediate surroundings, and the wavering light they
cast about the room leaves many shadows and unlit corners. There are
several tables about the room, where the inn's patrons eat, drink, and
generally enjoy themselves. The bar stands along the north wall and a
door to the kitchen lies to the southwest, and a staircase leads up to
the inn's rooms. The only visibile exit lies to the northeast.
l barkeep
The barkeep is a giant of a man. He stands nearly seven feet tall and looks
as though he might have a bit of ogre blood in him. He wears a pair of iron
armbands and a leather tunic. The tavern's patrons seem to reguard him with
respect if not fear.
l barmaid
The barmaid is a lovely wench wearing a low cut lacey blue blouse, green
bodice, and yellow skirts. She has long black hair and bright green eyes.
You notice quite a few of the inn's male patrons eyeing her with mouths
agape.
