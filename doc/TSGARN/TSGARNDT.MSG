ROOM1    {You are inside the dungeon entrance.
}
ROOM2    {You are standing inside the entrance to the dungeon. This rounded
stone and earth room bears the marks of digging tools and a number of
assorted claw and hoof marks in the walls and floor. The only obvious
exits are back up the stone stairway you just decended, to the west,
down a plain earthen tunnel, and to the northeast through an enormous
rough-hewn stone door.
}
ROOM3    {You are in a large cavern.
}
ROOM4    {You stand in a large cavern cluttered with stalagmites and stalagtites
that divide the room into many smaller chambers and passages and limit
vision in any direction to a few feet. The maze-like form of this cavern
is somewhat unnerving, as if someone or something had used natural forces
to create a very unnatural labyrinth. You have entered the lair of the
minotaur. The only exits are to the north and through an iron bound
oak door to the southeast.
}
ROOM5    {You are in a filthy cavern.
}
ROOM6    {You are now in a fairly large, but somewhat filthy cavern which smells
of urine and excrement. Tattered rags, broken bones, as well as ruined
weapons litter the floor. You get a great sense of foreboding as you
realize the carnage that must have taken place here. Caves exit to the
north, south, and southwest. There is also an iron door to the east.
}
ROOM7    {You are in an enormous cavern.
}
ROOM8    {You gape in awe at the piles of skulls in the center of this huge stone
room. The walls of this room are draped with the furs and skins of many
different types of animals, among which you recognize the furs of several
cave bears, formidable opponents themselves. The only visible exit is back
the way you came.
}
ROOM9    {You are in a huge cavern.
}
ROOM10   {The ceiling of this cavern is shrouded in darkness above your head. The
whole room is roughly circular with the exit to the south. Though the
walls and floor give away the fact that many battles have been fought
here, and several of them recently, you see no sign of the slain or the
equipment they may have carried. To the northeast is an unadorned bronze
door.
}
ROOM11   {You're at the top of a circular stairwell.
}
ROOM12   {You stand in a circular shaft with a stairwell that decends around the
outer wall into the darkness below. The air in this chamber is somewhat
cooler than that outside the bronze door. From far below comes a faint
shuffling sound that is barely audible and which you can make nothing of.

into the darkness. The room reeks of some odor you can't identify.
the furnishings of this room, such as they are, are completely out
of order. Rags and bits of straw lie strewn about the room with an
occasional bone or piece of wood. To the south lies the only exit
other than the spiral staircase.
}
ROOM85   {You are in filthy cave.
}
ROOM86   {The cave in which you now stand reminds you of a stable that's not
been cleaned in years. It is filthy and smells quite foul. Something
about this room seems familiar, but you can't put your finger on it.
Several bloodstains and other signs of mayhem put you ill at ease.
The visible exits are to the northeast, northwest, and southwest.
}
ROOM87   {You are in a smelly cave.
}
ROOM88   {This cave smells strongly of animals. It has the look and feel of
the den of some wild beast. The rotting carcass of some animal far
too mutilated and charred to identify says something of the occupant
of this cavern. The obvious exits are to the north and south.
}
ROOM89   {You are in a large cave.
}
ROOM90   {A horrific scene lies before you in the form of a pile of mangled
bones and skulls of various creatures, human and otherwise. An enormous
palet of furs and skins lies on one side of the room, and by the size
of it, it's likely the sleeping place of a giant. You start to think
better of having ventured this deep into the ground. The only exits are
east and southeast.
}
ROOM91   {You are in a dead end cave.
}
ROOM92   {You've entered what is obviously home to some wild beast. Likely
a bear or some subterranian predator. Old gnawed bones and claw marks
on the floor and walls of this small cave tell you that much. The only
visible exit lies back the way you came.
}
ROOM93   {You are in a grand hall.
}
ROOM94   {The splendor of the hall before you could have come right out of some
fantasic storybook legend. Enormous ornately carved black marble columns
inlaid with platinum and ivory bigger around than you are tall rise far
above to the ceiling, towering some two hundred or more feet above your
head. The floor and walls of this great hall are adorned with ornately
carved tiles and other noteworthy architecture with a very definite origin,
dwarves. The far wall of this hall is barely visible some thousand feet
away. Several things about this hall lead you to believe that either it's
original creators or someone or something has kept it up over the aeons.
Many torches in sconces along the walls light the hall about as brightly
as any underground room could be expected to be. The sheer size and
elegance of this magnificent hall leaves you in awe of it's builders.
The only visibile exits lie to the north through a grand archway, and to
the southeast through an ornately carved stone door.
}
ROOM95   {You're at the top of a stairwell.
}
ROOM96   {You stand in a circular shaft with a stairwell that decends around the
outer wall into the darkness below. The air in this chamber is somewhat
cooler than that outside.
}
ROOM97   {You at the bottom of a stairwell.
}
ROOM98   {You are now at the bottom of a long winding stair that leads up into
the darkness. This room is very damp and there is a smell of fungi and
and rot all around you. A strange shuffling sound echos down the passage
to the north, which seems to be the only other exit to this foreboding
cavern.
}
ROOM99   {You are in an enormous cavern.
}
ROOM100  {The ceiling of this enormous cavern is shrouded in darkness high above
your head. A huge tapestry covers the northern wall from the floor to
some forty feet above your head. The tapestry depicts a battle between
some exceptionally large members of the race of stone giants and a great
dragon with razor talons and teeth as large and sharp as sabres. The
only exit lies through an archway to the northwest.
}
ROOM101  {You are in a large cave.
}
ROOM102  {You've entered what is obviously home to some wild beast. Likely some
subterranian predator. Old gnawed bones and claw marks on the floor and
walls of this small cave tell you that, as do the bones and meat from
several freshly killed humanoids of some sort. The only visible exit
lies to the west.
}
ROOM103  {You're in an enormous natural cavern.
}
ROOM104  {You stare in wonder and the vastness and sheer beauty of the cavern
before you. You have heard of caverns such as this, where subteranian
streams and thousands of years of time wear away rock and create scenery
that can be seen no place else. You peer into the darkness between natural
formations including stalagtites and stalagmites, some over twenty feet
tall. Something about this chamber unnerves you, despite the apparently
peaceful setting. From what you can see, the only exit is to the west.
}
ROOM105  {You're in a dark cavern.
}
ROOM106  {Something about the shadows in the furthest reaches of this chamber
make the light your torch casts seem feeble. The darkness in the place
seems somewhat unnatural and sinister. The only apparent exit is to the
east.
}
ROOM107  {You're at an intersection.
}
ROOM108  {You are standing in a large cavern at the intersection of three passages.
They exit to the east, west, and north. This chamber smells strongly of
the dung of some beast you've apparently never before encountered. Many
crimson stains and scorch marks on the floor and walls belie the carnage
that must have taken place here at one time.
}
ROOM109  {You're in small cavern.
}
ROOM110  {You are standing in a small cavern at the corner of two passages. One
leads to the north, the other to the east. This cavern smells terrible
and is littered with tattered rags and bits of bone.
}
ROOM111  {You're in a pit.
}
ROOM112  {You are at the bottom of a pit. The smooth stone walls rise some ten
feet above your head. It doesn't seem likely that you could climb them
unaided. The remains of those unfortunate enough to become trapped here
litter the floor around you.
}
ROOM113  {You're in a small cave.
}
ROOM114  {You are in a small cave to the north of the dragon's lair. This area
is rather cramped and well hidden. It looks like it might be used to
conceal valuables.
}
ROOM115  {You're in the mountains.
}

          "Take from the elements that which is swiftest.
     Take from those which remain that which shares its origin.
              Take also the element which consumes it.
            Combine that which remains with its product.
             What remains as the result of this union?
     What shares the qualities of the byproduct of this union,
                  yet binds and pervades them all?
