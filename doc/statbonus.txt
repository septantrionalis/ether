For performance sake, we'll poll every 5 seconds :
p = prob(event in one day), q=1-p. Then the prob of not happening in 5 seconds is q^5, so prob happening at least once in 5 seconds is 1-q^5.

p=.06
q=.94
r=1-(.94)^5 = 27%

24 stam = 6% per seconds

There are 6 basic attributes in Tele Arena. 

Intellect - This is how smart your character is. Intellect improves your chance ‘to-hit’ in 
physical combat and also increases the potency of your offensive spells. For rogues, this 
attribute also add to the chance of successfully picking a lock, avoiding a trap or robbing 
another player. 

Knowledge - This is how wise your character is. This affects the potency of spells you cast on 
yourself or others. 

Physique - This is how strong your character is, how hard he/she hits in battle, and how much 
can be carried at one time. (see also, encumberance) 

Stamina - This determines how many hit points your character starts with, how many you get 
when you gain a higher level, how often you get thirsty or hungry, how many spaces you can 
run before you have to rest and how many hit points you regenerate every round. 

Agility - This is how agile your character is. This determines how fast your character may run, 
how many attacks you get, how often you ‘dodge’ an attack and how long you may run before 
‘tripping’.  

Charisma - This is how ‘attractive’ and influential you are. Along with Intellect, charisma 
makes a difference in the price of items at the various shops. A low charisma is sure to make you 
pay more for an item then the listed price. A high charisma allows you to buy at lower prices. 

There are also three additional statistics you need to be aware of; these are not attributes, they are 
gauges of your character’s health status and weight. 

Vitality - This is the amount of damage your character may sustain before dying. When this 
number reaches zero, your character is dead. As you ‘reroll’ for your attributes, pay attention 
to this statistic. If you have a vitality lower then 20, you might as well keep rerolling. You can 
play a character at such a low amount, but it is extremly difficult because any creatures worth 
attacking in Tele Arena can easily kill you in one round. 

Health - This is a status monitor on the general healthiness of your character. If you are hungry, 
thirsty or poisoned, this is where it will be displayed. 
Encumberance - This is how much your character weighs, including the gold being carried and 
all items. Equipped weapons and armor contribute to this. You will want a character with a 
good encumberance so that you can hold plenty of gold, potions and your weapon and armor. 
A good set of attributes is hard to come by, but it helps to know how your choice of race and character type effects the outcome. To see your stats, just type ‘st’ and press return. Below is a set of charts showing the maximum rollable set of attributes for each race. Since these are the highest numbers that can be rolled, you may want to roll for numbers that are a little below the maximum values listed. 

Rule of Thumb : Here is an idea of what to look for when rerolling. 
Intellect ---- 12 or higher. 
Knowledge -12 or higher. 
Physique ----18 or higher. 
Stamina ---- 16 or higher. 
Agility ------ 16 or higher. 
Charisma ---12 or higher, but not real important. 
Vitality ----- 23 or higher. 
The above stats are by no means the ones you should settle for unless you have rerolled for 
hours and just want a playable character. The above stats will certainly give you a playable 
character though they are generic in nature. (i.e., they do not take any class into account.) 
For spellcasters you might want to look for lower physical attributes and higher mental ones.
