=== General Info ===

This is the README file for Ether 1.0.

Ether is a Java application that allows the user to run the online 
multiplayer fantasy RPG, Tele-Arena, developed in the 1990s by Sean
Ferrel for the MajorBBS bulletin board system. This distribution does
not include the copyright data files. Ether, itself, is just an mud
engine that has the capabilities of reading in data from the original
Tele-Arena distribution.  The user has the capabilities of creating
his/her own data files and building their own world which may or may
not resemble Tele-Arena.

This distribution, in itself, is incomplete, since many of the elements
of the game are owned by Elwynor Technologies.

To legally run the Tele-Arena data files, I'd assume that the user
will have to own a legal copy of Tele-Arena for the MajorBBS system. 
This shouldn't prevent the user to run "Ether" as their own MUD
system.  Data files can be created by the user to create their own
world.  As of the initial release, the only world data files that 
exist are those from Tele-Arena.

This version of Ether will run on Mac OSX, Windows, and Unix.

=== Running ===

Java is required to run Ether.  Make sure the JVM is in your path.
For best results, use the Sun JVM 1.6, as that's what Ether was
compiled in.

Microsoft Windows:
  Use "run.bat"

Mac OSX, Linux, Other:
  Use "run.sh"

The command line is:
  java -DTaConfigFile="config/ta.properties" -jar ether.jar

=== Data Files ===

The following files are required to get Ether working.  These files 
can be generated by the "AreaBuilder" application or generated by
hand.  The "README.txt" file in the AreaBuilder application describes
how these files can be generated.

These files go in the "area" directory:
 town.xml
 world1.xml
 world_room_desc.xml
 town_room_desc.xml

These files go in the "data" directory:
 armor.dat
 spells.dat
 barriers.dat
 emotes.dat
 mobs.dat
 tamessages.properties
 traps.dat
 equipment.dat
 mob_weapons.dat
 teleporters.dat
